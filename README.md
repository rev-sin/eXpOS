# Welcome to the operating system workshop with [eXperimental Operating Sytem](http://exposnitc.github.io/index.html)

You can find all the items that you might want along your cruise down the line completing the stages in the roadmap.

## Prerequisites before we start following the setup instructions:

1. You are assumed to be on a linux based machine
2. Works perfectly on Ubuntu 20.04 (also docker is fine)

If you choose to work on windows, either install Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL2 or install docker and follow [stage-1](https://github.com/rev-sin/eXpOS/tree/stage-2) to get started with docker
